== Description ==
   Flexim is a modular and highly configurable architectural simulator for evaluating
   emerging multicore processors. Based on the past experience and guided by a few
   key software engineering concepts, it is developed from scratch in the object-oriented
   D system programing language to obtain good maintainability, reusability and modularity
   of the simulator code, and advocates further extensions via plugins. Its main components
   include a classic five-stage out-of-order issue processor core, multi-level coherent
   memory hierarchy with directory-based MESI coherence, and various supporting modules.

== Status ==
   CAUTION: This program is currently in its ALPHA quality. Please keep an eye on its rapid development.

== System Requirements ==
 1. Make sure that you have a Ubuntu 10.04 linux machine.
   Other popular linux distros may work as well if you are lucky.
 
 2. Make sure that you have the latest DMD 2.0 compiler installed.
   If not, go to this page and download "dmd D 2.0 compiler 1-click install for Ubuntu"
   http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html

== How to Build and Run Flexim ==
 1. Unpack the zip or tar file containing the Flexim source.
 
 2. In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), you can
    a) build Flexim using the command:
      make
    b) remove all the built files using the command:
      make clean
    Note: By default, the flexim binary is placed in the bin/ folder.

 3. In the subdirectory build/, you can simulate a MIPS32 LE program using the command:
    ./flexim <path-to-mipsel-executable> <args>
