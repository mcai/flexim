Flexim - A modular and highly configurable multicore simulator written in D
--------------------------------

Brief Introduction:
   Flexim is a modular and highly configurable architectural simulator for evaluating
   emerging multicore processors. Based on the past experience and guided by a few
   key software engineering concepts, it is developed from scratch in the object-oriented
   D system programing language to obtain good maintainability, reusability and modularity
   of the simulator code, and advocates further extensions via plugins. Its main components
   include a classic five-stage out-of-order issue processor core, multi-level coherent
   memory hierarchy with diectory-based MOESI coherence, and various supporting modules.

What you need to build your own Flexim:
 - Make sure that you have a Ubuntu 10.04 linux machine.
   Other popular linux distros may work as well if you are lucky.
 
 - Make sure that you have DMD 2.0 installed.
   If not, go to this page and download "dmd D 2.0 compiler 1-click install for Ubuntu"

How to build your own Flexim:
  In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), type
  the following to make Flexim:
    make

  And you can remove all the built files using the command:
    make clean

How to run your own Flexim:
  In the subdirectory bin/, you can find the previously built flexim executable.
  Run the following command to simulate a MIPS32 Little Endian executable:
    'bin/flexim <path-to-mipsel-executable> <args>'.
