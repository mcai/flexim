== About ==
   Flexim is a modular and highly configurable architectural simulator for evaluating
   emerging multicore processors. It can run statically compiled MIPS32 LE programs.

== Key Features ==
   Architectural:
   * Simulation of a classic five-stage superscalar pipeline with out-of-order execution.
   
   * Multi-level memory hierarchy with the directory-based MESI cache coherence protocol.
   
   Non-architectural:
   * Developed from scratch in the object-oriented system programming language D 2.0.
     Great efforts are made to advocate software engineering practices in the simulator construction.
     
   * A powerful infrastructure that provides common functionalities such as eventing and logging.
   
   * Pervasive use of XML based I/O for architectural, workload and experiment configs and stats.
   
   * Support for Syscall emulation simulation (i.e., application only, no need to boot an OS).
   
   * It provides a correct execution of several state-of-the-art benchmark suites,
     e.g., wcet_bench, Olden and CPU2006.
     
   * Easy to begin with and easy to use. No scripting.
     Only required are a statically compiled simulator executable and a few XML files.

== System Requirements ==
 1. Make sure that you have a Ubuntu 10.04 linux machine.
   Other popular linux distros may work as well if you are lucky.
 
 2. Make sure that you have the latest DMD 2.0 compiler installed.
   If not, go to this page and download "dmd D 2.0 compiler 1-click install for Ubuntu"
   http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html

== How to Build and Run Flexim ==
 1. Unpack the zip or tar file containing the Flexim source.
 
 2. In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), you can
    a) build Flexim using the command:
      make
    b) remove all the built files using the command:
      make clean
    Note: By default, the flexim binary is placed in the bin/ folder.
 
 3. Download and unpack cross-compiler-mipsel.tar.bz2 from http://github.com/mcai/flexim/downloads/.
   Use it to compile MIPS32 LE programs to be simulated by Flexim.
   See the subdirectory microbenchmarks/ of the distribution for sample use.

 4. In the subdirectory build/, you can simulate a MIPS32 LE program using the command:
    ./flexim <path-to-mipsel-executable> <args>
