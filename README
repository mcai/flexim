Flexim - A modular and highly configurable multicore simulator written in D
(version: 0.1 Prerelease)
--------------------------------

This README briefly describes what Flexim is and how to setup & run Flexim. For more details, 
please refer to the Flexim User Guide under the subdirectory doc/ of the distribution.

== About ==
   Flexim is a modular and highly configurable architectural simulator for evaluating
   emerging multicore processors. It can run statically compiled MIPS32 LE programs.

== Web Site ==   
   Please obtain the latest Flexim code from http://github.com/mcai/flexim.

== Key Features ==
   Architectural:
   * Simulation of a classic five-stage superscalar pipeline with out-of-order execution.
   
   * Multi-level memory hierarchy with the directory-based MESI cache coherence protocol.
   
   Non-architectural:
   * Developed from scratch in the object-oriented system programming language D 2.0.
     Great efforts are made to advocate software engineering practices in the simulator construction.
     
   * A powerful infrastructure that provides common functionalities such as eventing and logging.
   
   * Pervasive use of XML-based I/O for architectural, workload and simulation configs and stats.
   
   * Support for Syscall-emulation mode simulation (i.e., application only, no need to boot an OS).
   
   * Correct execution of several state-of-the-art benchmark suites,
     e.g., wcet_bench, Olden and CPU2006.
     
   * Easy to begin with and easy to use. No scripting.
     Only required are a statically compiled simulator executable and a few XML files.

== System Requirements ==
 1. Make sure that you have a Ubuntu 10.04 linux machine.
   Other popular linux distros may work as well if you are lucky.
 
 2. Make sure that you have the latest DMD 2.0 compiler installed.
   If not, go to this page and download "dmd D 2.0 compiler 1-click install for Ubuntu"
   http://www.digitalmars.com/d/download.html
   
 3. Make sure that you have the latest GtkD installed.
   If not, please type the command from console: 'svn co http://svn.dsource.org/projects/gtkd/trunk'.
   Then follow the instructions that provided to compile and install GtkD.
   Hints: The latest GtkD SVN version can be slightly modified to make it compile under the latest DMD 2.0 compiler.

== How to compile Benchmarks for Flexim ==
   Flexim supports the statically linked MIPS32 LE binaries. It supports the full set of wcet_bench benchmarks.
   Other popular benchmarks such as Olden and CPU2006 are being tested.
 
   Download and unpack cross-compiler-mipsel.tar.bz2 from http://github.com/mcai/flexim/downloads/.
   Use it to compile MIPS32 LE binaries to be simulated by Flexim.
   See the Makefiles under the subdirectory tests/ of the distribution for sample use.

== How to Build and Run Flexim ==
 1. Unpack the zip or tar file containing the Flexim source.
 
 2. In the main directory of the distribution (the one that this file is in), you can
    a) build Flexim using the command:
      make
    b) remove all the built files using the command:
      make clean
    Note: By default, the flexim binary is placed in the bin/ folder.

 3. In order to run the simulator, you will need to set up a few configuration files.
    The Flexim User Guide describes these files in detail.
    A few sample configuration files have been provided for your reference.


Good Luck!
